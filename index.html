		<p>Disney has been creating some of the best content for kids 
			and adults for decades. I've grown up watching these movies
			and have loved every single one of them. The stories have provided 
			themes for people of all ages with a splash of tons of music 
			and a bit of magic!</p>

		<h2>History</h2>
		
		<p>Walt Disney arrived in California in the summer of 1923 with a lot 
			of hopes but little else. He had made a cartoon in Kansas City about 
			a little girl in a cartoon world, called Alice’s Wonderland, and he decided 
			that he could use it as his “pilot” film to sell a series of these “Alice Comedies” 
			to a distributor. Soon after arriving in California, he was successful. A distributor 
			in New York, M. J. Winkler, contracted to distribute the Alice Comedies on October 16, 1923, 
			and this date became the start of the Disney company. Originally known as the Disney Brothers 
			Cartoon Studio, with Walt Disney and his brother, Roy, as equal partners, the company soon changed its name, 
			at Roy’s suggestion, to the Walt Disney Studio.</p>

		<p>It was at the Hyperion Studio, after the loss of Oswald, that Walt had to come up with a new character, and that character was Mickey Mouse. With his chief animator, 
			Ub Iwerks, Walt designed the famous mouse and gave him a personality that endeared him to all. Ub animated two Mickey Mouse cartoons, but Walt was unable to sell them 
			because they were silent films, and sound was revolutionizing the movie industry. So, they made a third Mickey Mouse cartoon, this time with fully synchronized sound, 
			and Steamboat Willie opened to rave reviews at the Colony Theater in New York November 18, 1928. A cartoon star, Mickey Mouse, was born. The new character was immediately 
			popular, and, a lengthy series of Mickey Mouse cartoons followed.</p>

		<p>Not one to rest on his laurels, Walt Disney soon produced another series—the Silly Symphonies—to go with the Mickey series. It featured different casts of characters in 
			each film and enabled animators to experiment with stories that relied less on the gags and quick humor of the Mickey cartoons and more on mood, emotion, and musical themes. 
			Eventually the Silly Symphonies turned into the training ground for all Disney artists as they prepared for the advent of animated feature films. Flowers and Trees, a Silly Symphony 
			and the first full-color cartoon, won the Academy Award® for Best Cartoon for 1932, the first year that the Academy offered such a category. For the rest of that decade, 
			a Disney cartoon won the Oscar® every year.</p>

		<p>While the cartoons were gaining popularity in movie houses, the Disney staff found that merchandising the characters was an additional source of revenue. Soon there were Mickey Mouse 
			dolls, dishes, toothbrushes, radios, figurines—almost everything you could think of bore Mickey’s likeness. The year 1930 was a big one for the mouse that started it all, as it saw 
			the first Mickey Mouse book and newspaper comic strip published.</p>

		<p>Since then Disney has been a part of everyone's childhood and many of us have gron up enjoying and watching these movies.
			Out of the many Disnay movies out there that I have come to love, these are some of my favourite movies so far that have 
			represented strong, independent women from different cultures and had been 
			even now an inspiration for many young girls and adults!</p>


		<p>After acheiving brief success with cartoon shows and merchandise, one night in 1934, Walt informed his animators that they were going to make an animated feature film, 
			and then he told them the story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. There were some skeptics in the group, 
			but before long everyone had caught Walt’s enthusiasm, and work began in earnest. It took three years, but 
			the landmark film debuted on December 21, 1937 and became a spectacular hit. Snow White soon became the highest-grossing 
			film of all time, a record it held until it was surpassed by Gone with the Wind.</p>
