		<h2>Overview</h2>

		<p>Moana tells the story of a spirited teenager who sets out on a daring mission 
			to save her people — to prove herself as a master wayfinder and fulfill her 
			ancestors’ unfinished quest. During her journey, she meets the once-mighty demi-god Maui, 
			and together, they traverse the open ocean on an action-packed voyage, encountering enormous 
			fiery creatures and facing impossible odds.</p>

			<h2>Meet the characters</h2>

			<div class="grid_container">

			<h3>Moana</h3>
			<img src="images/Moana.jpg" alt="The main character Moana in attack mode holding a paddle. She is seen wearing a a beige dress." width="200"/>
			<p>Moana is an adventurous, tenacious and compassionate 16-year-old who is struggling 
				to find her true self. While her father, Chief Tui, pressures her to follow in his 
				footsteps and lead their island one day, Moana is drawn to the sea. The people of 
				her village are forbidden to go beyond the safety of the reef, yet the open ocean 
				seems to beckon Moana.</p>

			<h3>Maui</h3>
			<img src="images/Moana_maui.jpg" alt="The main charater Maui holding a hook shaped weapon" width="200"/>
			<p>Maui is a demigod. Half god, half mortal, all awesome. Charismatic and funny, 
				he wields a magical fishhook that allows him to shapeshift into all kinds of animals 
				and pull up islands from the sea. Maui was once considered the greatest hero in Oceania; 
				his body is covered with tattoos of his extraordinary feats, including a mini-version of 
				himself that acts as Maui’s conscience.</p>

			<h3>Gramma Tala</h3>
			<img src="images/Moana_Gramma_Tala.jpg" alt="Moana's Grandma, Tala wlaking with the help of a walking stick" width="200"/>
			<p>Gramma Tala, Moana’s confidante and best friend, shares her granddaughter’s special connection 
				to the ocean. Although her son, Chief Tui, is a no-nonsense leader, Gramma Tala most definitely 
				dances to the beat of her own drum. She feels in her soul that the ocean has big plans for Moana, 
				but she won’t reveal the legendary secrets of their wayfinding ancestors till the time is right.</p>

			<h3>Tui and Sina</h3>
			<img src="images/Moana_Tui_Sina.jpg" alt="Moana's parents Tui and Sina standing together on a terrain surrounded by bushery and plants" width="200"/>
			<p>Moana’s father, Chief Tui, is the gregarious and well-respected leader of the people of Motunui Island. 
				He wants Moana to follow in his footsteps as leader of their people but fears his daughter’s connection 
				with the ocean and the world that lies beyond their reef.
				Moana’s mother always has her back. Playful, sharp and strong-willed, Sina appreciates Moana’s longing to be 
				on the water. But much like Tui, her hard-headed husband, Sina wants to protect her daughter from the fabled 
				dangers beyond the reef. Above all, Sina trusts Moana to make the right decisions.</p>

			<h3>Hei Hei</h3>
			<img src="images/Moana_heihei.jpg" alt="Hei Hei is a green chicekn and can be seen with his eyes bulging out in the picture" width="200"/>
			<p>Hei Hei is one dumb rooster. The village idiot, in fact. When the clueless chicken accidentally stows away on Moana’s canoe, 
				he lands a front-row seat for her epic journey. But when Maui targets the feathered fowl as his next meal, kind-hearted Moana 
				sticks her neck out to save Heihei.</p>

			<h3>Pua</h3>
			<img src="images/Moana_pua.jpg" alt="Pua, Moana's pet pig, can be seen resting his back on a beach shore with a playful expression" width="200"/>
			<p>Pua is Moana’s loyal pet pig with puppy energy and an innocent puppy brain. He’s guileless and sweet and would do anything for Moana. 
				Pua just wants her to be happy.</p>
